As an intern at Pinnacle Labs, I am thrilled to announce the completion of my project on Fake News Detection. Over the course of my internship, I delved into the intricate world of misinformation and employed cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing and machine learning to develop a robust system capable of discerning fact from fiction. This project not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the societal implications of misinformation in today's digital age. I am immensely grateful for the guidance and support of my mentors and colleagues, whose expertise has been invaluable in shaping this endeavor. As I reflect on this achievement, I am eager to continue my journey of learning and growth, leveraging the insights gained from this project to tackle future challenges in the field of data science.----TASK-1.
